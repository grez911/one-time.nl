            <b>What is this site?</b><br>
            This is a disposable encrypted image hosting. When you upload an
            image, your browser generates a random password, encrypts image
            with this passwords and sends ciphertext to the server. Password
            stored in the link to the image after '#' symbol, and it never
            leaves your computer, if you aren't sharing a link with somebody,
            of course.<br>
            When you open the link the process is inverted: you download the
            ciphertext from server, decrypt it with password extracted from the
            link and see a picture. Take a good look (or save it), because it's
            already deleted from the server!<br><br>
            <b>Wait, are you not prohibiting saving of images?</b><br>
            It's impossible. If I forbid a right-click of a mouse or make
            something similar, you can always take a screenshot or even a photo
            of the screen with an external camera.<br><br>
            <b>What limitations are set on the site?</b><br>
            The maximum file size: 10 MB.<br>
            Allowed file types: jpg, png and gif.<br>
            Also unviewed images will be deleted after 30 days.<br><br>
            <b>Are images really deleted after first view? Do I have to trust
                you?</b><br>
            Yes, you have to trust me. But think about it: why in the world do
            I need to store an encrypted junk which I can not even view? This
            project is non-profit, there is no ads and other tracking shit, I
            even do not ask for donations, so resourses are limited.<br>
            Also no logs are recorded on the server, but don't trust me on word
            and use TOR for additional security.<br>
            And do not forget to delete EXIF from your photos, it can contain
            a GPS photo location, a precise time, an unique ID number of the
            device and many other sensitive information.<br><br>
            <b>JS cryptography is bad.</b><br>
            I know, but I do whatever I can to make it more secure. I use HSTS,
            CSP and integrity check of all loaded JavaScripts and CSS. JS
            code is kept is simple as possible, no external libs are used.
            JavaScript code of all site combined is about 800 lines long.<br>
            And believe me, I really don't want to store a possible illegal
            stuff on my server in a plain form.<br><br>
            <b>Where can I see the site code?</b><br>
            The frontend is available for you in a browser inspector. Or you
            can download the
            <a href="https://github.com/grez911/one-time.nl">repository</a>
            where is contained the frontend and backend code, and even the
            server configuration files, so you can clone this site completely.
